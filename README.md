Divine Wisdom's own github page, hosted by gaster#2411 of 5-1!

  Hello. I am gaster#2411. Don't ask for my real name unless you can prove that you are from Divine Wisdom Catholic Academy(I suggest you apply for it.
It's a really good school. Not an ad btw, it's my truthful opinion.)You can contact me on discor-just kidding. For security, I have decided to not use discord, ~~because my lawyer advised me not to~~because it's against the Terms of Service for a child to do so. 
  Also, hiring programmers. Will be paid in potatoes and pure nitrogen.
